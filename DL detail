🔥 Deep Learning (DL) Complete Map

Deep Learning = a subfield of ML using Neural Networks with many layers.

DL learns features automatically → no manual feature engineering needed like traditional ML.


1️⃣ Core Building Block → Artificial Neural Network (ANN / MLP)

The foundation for all DL models.

Concept	                Meaning
Neuron	                Takes input → applies weight → passes through activation
Layer	                  Group of neurons (input, hidden, output)
Forward                 Propagation	Passing input through layers
Loss Function	          Measures prediction error
Backpropagation	        Adjusts weights to reduce loss
Optimizer	              Updates weights (SGD, Adam)
Epoch	                  One full pass over training data
Batch Size	            Samples processed at once


🔗 ANN used for: basic classification/regression when data is structured/tabular.

2️⃣ Deep Learning Types

C) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for Sequences

Good for time-dependent data (text, speech, time-series).

Types:
Model	                   Works For
RNN	                     Sequential short memory
LSTM	                   Long-term dependencies
GRU	                     Faster than LSTM, similar power
Bi-directional LSTM	     Reads forward + backward

Used in:
✔ Text generation
✔ Sentiment classification
✔ Speech recognition
✔ Stock/time-series forecasting

But — RNN/LSTM are being replaced by Transformers.


D) Transformers (Most powerful modern DL family)

This is the backbone of GenAI, LLMs like GPT, BERT, etc.
