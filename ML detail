Machine Learning = Algorithms that learn patterns from data.

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-Supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning
5. Ensemble Learning (Part of Supervised but important separately)


1️⃣ Supervised Learning

(Training with Labelled Data → Input → Output already known)

Used for prediction, classification, forecasting.

📌 Two types:
Type	              Output
Regression	        Continuous value (price, temperature)
Classification	    Categories/Classes (spam/not spam, disease/healthy)


A. Regression Algorithms 📈

| Algorithm | Concept | When to Use |
|---|---|
| Linear Regression | Fits straight line to data | Simple relationships |
| Multiple Linear Regression | Many features | Multi-variable prediction |
| Polynomial Regression | Fits curve (higher degree) | Non-linear patterns |
| Ridge Regression | L2 Regularization | Avoid overfitting |
| Lasso Regression | L1 Regularization | Feature selection |
| ElasticNet | Ridge + Lasso mix | When need both control & selection |
| Support Vector Regression (SVR) | Margin-based regression | Small-medium dataset, non-linear |
| Decision Tree Regressor | Tree split on features | Interpretability |
| Random Forest Regressor | Many trees voting | High accuracy, stable |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | Boosting trees step-wise | Strong for tabular data |
| XGBoost/LGBM/CatBoost | Optimized boosting | Kaggle winning models |
| KNN Regression | Based on nearest points | Small datasets, simple |
| Bayesian Regression | Probabilistic approach | Uncertainty estimation |

B. Classification Algorithms 🧾

| Algorithm | Concept | Where used |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Probability of class | Spam/not spam |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Class by neighbors | Small data |
| Decision Tree Classifier | Tree splits | Easy to understand |
| Random Forest Classifier | Many trees → voting | High accuracy |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier | Boosting errors | Strong performance |
| XGBoost/LGBM/CatBoost | Advanced boosting | Kaggle top scores |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Best separating margin | High-dimensional data |
| Naive Bayes | Based on probability | Text/sentiment classification |
| Neural Networks (Basic MLP) | Multi-layer perceptron | When data large & complex |


2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

(No labels → model learns patterns itself)

Used for structure discovery, segmentation, compression.

A. Clustering Algorithms

| Algorithm | Concept | Use Cases |
|---|---|
| K-Means | Groups data into K clusters | Customer segmentation |
| Hierarchical Clustering | Tree-like clustering | Dendrogram analysis |
| DBSCAN | Density based | Irregular clusters, outliers |
| Mean Shift | Peak/centroid based | Arbitrary shape clusters |
| Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) | Probabilistic clusters | Soft clustering |


B. Dimensionality Reduction

| Algorithm | Concept | Use |
|---|---|
| PCA (Principal Component Analysis) | Reduce features using variance | Speed up ML |
| SVD | Matrix decomposition | Recommendation systems |
| t-SNE | Visualization in 2D/3D | Image/text embeddings |
| UMAP | Faster, preserves structure | Deep learning embeddings |


3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning

(When few labelled + many unlabelled samples)

Algorithms include:

Self Training

Label Propagation

Label Spreading

Semi-supervised SVM

Used when labeling is expensive → medical images, NLP datasets.

4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning (RL)

(Agent learns by reward/punishment → trial-and-error)

Algorithms:

Category	Examples
Value Based	Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN)
Policy Based	REINFORCE
Actor-Critic	A3C, PPO, DDPG

Used in games, robotics, self-driving, optimization systems.

5️⃣ Ensemble Learning (Very Important!)

Combines multiple models for better performance.

Technique	Examples
Bagging	Random Forest
Boosting	XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
Stacking	Multiple models stacked
Voting	Majority voting classifier
